# Themes
DrMD themes live in the `themes/` directory.

If you wish to use any theme beside the default theme provided by DrMD then all you need to do it copy the `themes/basic/` contents into a new folder within the themes directory, for example `themes/my-theme`. Then in `assets/js/doctor` change the `theme` constant to reflect the name you chose.
