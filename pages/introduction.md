# Doctor Markdown (DrMD) Documentation
Welcome to the documentation for Doctor Markdown. DrMD is a tool that automatically generates HTML pages from markdown files. For more information on the markdown syntax then checkout the [Markdown Syntax](/r/markdown) documentation.

You can style your documentation using themes, which are written using plain ol' fashioned HTML. Themes do inherit some functionality from angular.js to allow for nesting and dynamic content, for more information please refer to the [Themes Documentation](/r/themes).
